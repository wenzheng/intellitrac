== Toolbar ==
There will be a toolbar at the top and a list of reports at the bottom. It will be always visible, however it will change its content depending on the current context. It will always contain navigation buttons (home ([#Reports_list reports list]), back, [#Ticket_editor new ticket]) in a constant place, e.g. right-aligned.

== Reports list ==
It will be the first state. Toolbar will contain buttons:

 * Open report (only active if a report is selected in the list) - navigates to [#Tickets_list list of tickets].
 * Add new report - navigates to [#Report_editor report editor].
 * Edit report (only active if a report is selected in the list) - navigates to [#Report_editor report editor].
 * Remove report (only active if a report is selected in the list) - removes selected report (possibly with a prompt).

== Tickets list ==

Tickets list will be a table. Every ticket will be described by:
 * number
 * summary
 * type
 * owner
 * status

Buttons in the toolbar: 

 * Start working on a ticket - registers that the user has just started working on this ticket, starting a timer. It will be active if all these conditions are met:
   * the user is not working on any other ticket yet,
   * there is a selected ticket in the list.

 * Stop working on a ticket - updates this ticket, adding calculated time. It will be active if all these conditions are met:
   * there is a selected ticket in the list,
   * the user started working on this ticket (by clicking "start working on a ticket").

 * Pause working on a ticket - pauses the timer for this ticket working time, but does not stop it - the user is still working on this ticket. Required conditions:
   * there is a selected ticket in the list,
   * the user started working on this ticket (by clicking "start working on a ticket").

 * Edit ticket - navigates to [#Ticket_editor ticket editor].

== Report editor ==

 * Title
 * Description
 * Query

== Ticket editor ==

Analogous to the web ticket editor.
