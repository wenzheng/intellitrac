#summary GUI description.

= Main panel =

This panel will be visible within IDE by clicking a button on the IDE toolbar (just like "Ant", "Maven projects" or "TODO"). It will consist of three tabs: [GUI#Tickets tickets], [GUI#Wiki wiki] and [GUI#Help help].

== # Tickets ==

=== Toolbar ===
There will be a toolbar at the top and a list of reports at the bottom. It will be always visible, however it will change its content depending on the current context. It will always contain navigation buttons (home ([GUI#ReportsList reports list]), back, [GUI#TicketEditor new ticket]) in a constant place, e.g. right-aligned.

=== List of reports ===
It will be the first state of the Tickets tab. Toolbar will contain buttons:

 * Open report (only active if a report is selected in the list) - navigates to [GUI#TicketsList list of tickets].
 * Add new report - navigates to [GUI#ReportEditor report editor].
 * Edit report (only active if a report is selected in the list) - navigates to [GUI#ReportEditor report editor].
 * Remove report (only active if a report is selected in the list) - removes selected report (possibly with a prompt).

=== List of tickets ===

 * Start working on a ticket - registers that the user has just started working on this ticket, starting a timer. It will be active if all these conditions are met:
   * the user is not working on any other ticket yet,
   * there is a selected ticket in the list.

 * Stop working on a ticket - updates this ticket, adding calculated time. It will be active if all these conditions are met:
   * there is a selected ticket in the list,
   * the user started working on this ticket (by clicking "start working on a ticket").

 * Pause working on a ticket - pauses the timer for this ticket working time, but does not stop it - the user is still working on this ticket. Required conditions:
   * there is a selected ticket in the list,
   * the user started working on this ticket (by clicking "start working on a ticket").

 * Edit ticket - navigates to [GUI#TicketEditor ticket editor].
