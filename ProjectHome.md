**Important note: this project is not being developed anymore.**

IntelliTrac is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin (aimed at versions 7 & 8) that enables tight integration with Trac, a popular project management system. Its main aim is to facilitate Trac support, i.e. enabling users to interface with Trac environments from within IDE (no need to use Trac web browser interface).
